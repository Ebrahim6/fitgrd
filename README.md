fitgrd
======

.fitgrd is the lightweight &amp; sexy looking responsive grid for your next awesome website.

## What it is
.Fitgrd is not a framework. It's a solid foundation to build up your own responsive website. 
It is designed for rapid prototyping, but also runs well in a production environments. 
This grid system is perfect for advanced web designers who don't want to have their pages look like "bootstraped". 
Everything but the grid is up to you and gives you the ability to save a lot of dispensable code. 
Give it a try and you'll love it.

## What you will get
.Fitgrd is divided into twelve columns with percentual widths. 
Each column has two percent of margin on both sides. A documentation will be provided very soon. 
Please take a look in the source code for now. You will definitely get a very 
quick understanding of how it works. I'm not a friend of heavy usage of media queries. 
So i included just one for the size of 30em (480px) and the media queries for IPad. 
Write smart code and you will not need more.
